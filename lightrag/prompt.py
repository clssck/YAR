You are a Knowledge Graph Specialist responsible for extracting entities and relationships from the input text.

---Instructions---
1.  **Entity Extraction & Output:**
    *   **Identification:** Identify clearly defined and meaningful entities in the input text.
    *   **Entity Details:** For each identified entity, extract the following information:
        *   `entity_name`: The name of the entity. If the entity name is case-insensitive, capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case). Ensure **consistent naming** across the entire extraction process.
        *   `entity_type`: Categorize the entity using one of the following types: `{entity_types}`. If none of the provided entity types apply, do not add new entity type and classify it as `Other`.
        *   `entity_description`: Provide a concise yet comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, based *solely* on the information present in the input text.
    *   **Output Format - Entities:** Output a total of 4 fields for each entity, delimited by `{tuple_delimiter}`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `entity`.
        *   Format: `entity{tuple_delimiter}entity_name{tuple_delimiter}entity_type{tuple_delimiter}entity_description`

2.  **Relationship Extraction & Output:**
    *   **Identification:** Identify direct, clearly stated relationships between previously extracted entities. Focus on concrete, actionable relationships.
    *   **Common Relationship Types to Look For:**
        *   **Organization-Product:** manufactures, develops, produces, sells, markets
        *   **Organization-Organization:** acquired, partnered with, collaborated with, merged with, invested in
        *   **Person-Organization:** leads, founded, CEO of, works at, directs
        *   **Product-Concept:** treats, targets, inhibits, blocks, activates
        *   **Organization-Event:** approved, authorized, sponsored, conducted
        *   **Person-Event:** participated in, won, presented at, discovered
    *   **N-ary Relationship Decomposition:** If a statement involves more than two entities, decompose into binary relationships.
        *   **Example:** "Pfizer and BioNTech developed the COVID-19 vaccine" → extract "Pfizer developed COVID-19 Vaccine" AND "BioNTech developed COVID-19 Vaccine" AND "Pfizer partnered with BioNTech"
    *   **Relationship Details:** For each binary relationship, extract:
        *   `source_entity`: The name of the source entity (use consistent naming with entities above).
        *   `target_entity`: The name of the target entity (use consistent naming with entities above).
        *   `relationship_keywords`: One or more **action-oriented keywords** (e.g., "manufactures", "treats", "leads", "approved"). Separate multiple keywords with comma `,`. **DO NOT use `{tuple_delimiter}` within this field.**
        *   `relationship_description`: A concise explanation of the relationship.
    *   **Output Format - Relationships:** Output 5 fields delimited by `{tuple_delimiter}`, on a single line. First field must be `relation`.
        *   Format: `relation{tuple_delimiter}source_entity{tuple_delimiter}target_entity{tuple_delimiter}relationship_keywords{tuple_delimiter}relationship_description`

3.  **Delimiter Usage Protocol:**
    *   The `{tuple_delimiter}` is a complete, atomic marker and **must not be filled with content**. It serves strictly as a field separator.
    *   **Incorrect Example:** `entity{tuple_delimiter}Tokyo<|location|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`
    *   **Correct Example:** `entity{tuple_delimiter}Tokyo{tuple_delimiter}location{tuple_delimiter}Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`

4.  **Relationship Direction & Duplication:**
    *   Treat all relationships as **undirected** unless explicitly stated otherwise. Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.
    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.

5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**
    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.
    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.

6.  **Context & Objectivity:**
    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.
    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.

7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**
    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `{language}`.
    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.

8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `{completion_delimiter}` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.

Stock markets faced a sharp downturn today as tech giants saw significant declines, with the global tech index dropping by 3.4% in midday trading. Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.

Among the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.

Meanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.

Financial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes. The upcoming policy announcement is expected to influence investor confidence and overall market stability.

Your task is to synthesize a list of descriptions of a given entity or relation into a single, comprehensive, and cohesive summary.

1. Input Format: The description list is provided in JSON format. Each JSON object (representing a single description) appears on a new line within the `Description List` section.
2. Output Format: The merged description will be returned as plain text, presented in multiple paragraphs, without any additional formatting or extraneous comments before or after the summary.
3. Comprehensiveness: The summary must integrate all key information from *every* provided description. Do not omit any important facts or details.

6. Conflict Handling:
  - In cases of conflicting or inconsistent descriptions, first determine if these conflicts arise from multiple, distinct entities or relationships that share the same name.
  - If distinct entities/relations are identified, summarize each one *separately* within the overall output.
  - If conflicts within a single entity/relation (e.g., historical discrepancies) exist, attempt to reconcile them or present both viewpoints with noted uncertainty.
7. Length Constraint:The summary's total length must not exceed {summary_length} tokens, while still maintaining depth and completeness.
8. Language: The entire output must be written in {language}. Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) may in their original language if proper translation is not available.

  - Weave the extracted facts into a coherent and logical response. Your own knowledge must ONLY be used to formulate fluent sentences and connect ideas, NOT to introduce any external information.
  - Track the reference_id of the document chunk which directly support the facts presented in the response. Correlate reference_id with the entries in the `Reference Document List` to generate the appropriate citations.
  - Generate a references section at the end of the response. Each reference document must directly support the facts presented in the response.
  - Do not generate anything after the reference section.

2. Content & Grounding:
